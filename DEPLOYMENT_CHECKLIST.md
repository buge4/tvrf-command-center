## ðŸš€ Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","service":"TVRF Command Center"}

# Test chat
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, deployment test!"}'

# Automated verification
node verify-deployment.js https://your-app.railway.app
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start**
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify all environment variables set
- Ensure database schema created
- Check for syntax errors in code

**Database connection errors**
- Verify Supabase credentials
- Check Supabase project is active
- Ensure RLS policies configured
- Test database connection locally first

**Chat API errors**
- Verify Claude API key valid
- Check API quota/limits
- Review error logs
- Test API key with curl directly

**CORS errors**
- Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS with Railway domain
- Verify origin matches exactly
- Check for typos in domain
