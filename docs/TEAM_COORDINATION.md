# TVRF Command Center - Multi-Agent Team Coordination

## Overview

The TVRF Command Center implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that enables intelligent collaboration between specialized AI agents. This system leverages the power of Claude Opus to coordinate complex tasks through consensus-driven decision making.

## Architecture

![Multi-Agent Team Coordination Flow](multi-agent-flow.png)

The multi-agent coordination system follows a structured workflow:

1. **Task Initiation**: User requests are processed by the AI Commander
2. **Session Creation**: A new team session is created with defined parameters
3. **Role Assignment**: Tasks are delegated to specialized agents based on their expertise
4. **Collaborative Analysis**: Each agent contributes their specialized insights
5. **Consensus Building**: Decisions are made through weighted voting mechanisms
6. **Execution**: Approved decisions are implemented with team monitoring
7. **Performance Tracking**: Team effectiveness is continuously measured and improved

## Agent Roles

## Database Schema

![Team Coordination Database Schema](database-schema.png)

The team coordination system uses a specialized database schema to track:

- **Team Sessions**: Coordination sessions with metadata and participants
- **Agent Contributions**: Individual agent outputs and recommendations
- **Consensus Records**: Decision-making process and outcomes
- **Communications**: Inter-agent messaging and coordination
- **Performance Metrics**: Team efficiency and effectiveness tracking

## Consensus Mechanisms

### Decision Categories

| Category | Threshold | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| üî¥ Critical | 80% (4/5 agents) | Security, financial, legal decisions |
| üü° Major | 60% (3/5 agents) | Feature development, architecture changes |
| üü¢ Minor | 40% (2/5 agents) | UI changes, minor fixes, documentation |

### Weighted Voting System

Each agent has a specialized weight based on their expertise:

```javascript
const agentWeights = {
  'SystemAnalyst': 0.25, // Technical decisions
  'Development': 0.25,   // Implementation decisions
  'Monitoring': 0.20,    // Performance decisions
  'Strategy': 0.20,      // Business decisions
  'Security': 0.10       // Security validation
};
```

### Consensus Process

1. **Input Collection**: Gather recommendations from all agents
2. **Weight Calculation**: Apply agent expertise weights
3. **Threshold Validation**: Check if consensus threshold is met
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle disagreements through mediation
5. **Decision Recording**: Store final decision and reasoning

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: TVRF Platform Deployment

```javascript
// Create team coordination session
const session = await teamCoordination.createTeamSession(
  'TVRF Platform Deployment - Production',
  'development',
  'AICommander'
);

// Add agent contributions
await teamCoordination.addAgentContribution(session.sessionId, ...);
await teamCoordination.buildConsensus(session.sessionId, ...);
```

### Example 2: Emergency Response

```javascript
// Rapid emergency response
const emergency = await teamCoordination.createEmergencyResponse(
  'SystemAnomaly',
  { severity: 'HIGH', description: 'Unusual entropy patterns' }
);
```

### Example 3: Team Analytics

```javascript
// Performance analysis
const analytics = await teamCoordination.getTeamAnalytics('7d');
```

## API Endpoints
